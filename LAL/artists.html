                Joan Miró was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist, renowned for his imaginative 
                and colorful work that bridged Surrealism, abstraction, and the unconscious mind. 
                Born in 1893 in Barcelona, he was deeply influenced by Catalan folk art and the vibrant 
                culture of his native region, as well as by the surrealist movement and its exploration 
                of dreams and irrationality. Miró's work often incorporated elements of the subconscious, 
                with symbols, biomorphic forms, and playful abstraction reflecting his fascination with 
                the inner workings of the mind. He was inspired by nature, particularly the landscapes 
                of his childhood, as well as by the works of artists like Paul Klee and Henri Matisse. 
                Throughout his career, Miró sought to liberate art from conventional constraints, 
                using bold colors, simple shapes, and spontaneous techniques to create a unique, 
                highly personal visual language.

                    Salvador Dalí was a Spanish painter and leading figure in the Surrealist movement, 
                    known for his eccentric style and dreamlike imagery. Born in 1904, he was deeply influenced by 
                    the Freudian ideas of the unconscious mind, which shaped his exploration of dreams, desires, 
                    and irrationality in his art. Dalí's most iconic works, such as <i>The Persistence of Memory</i>, 
                    reflect his fascination with time, decay, and the fluidity of reality. His inspiration also 
                    came from the classical masters, as well as from his love of scientific discoveries, 
                    psychoanalysis, and his personal obsessions. Throughout his career, Dalí sought to 
                    challenge conventional perceptions of reality, blending meticulous technique with bizarre, 
                    often unsettling imagery that pushed the boundaries of visual art.

                    One of the earliest involved in the Surrealist movement, Remedios Varo broke 
                    barriers in the production of surrealist artwork that centered on women. 
                    Many of her artworks featured self-portraits and images documenting her travels 
                    and interactions with her peers.<br><br>
                    Varo was also one of the first Surrealists to work in North America, 
                    with most of her career occurring during her time living in Mexico.<br><br>
                    Like other Surrealists, Varo’s work explored metaphysical and philosophical 
                    themes including scientific theories like Darwinism. While Andre Breton originally 
                    excluded women from the movement, Varo was also one of the first to be recognized 
                    by Breton to have contributed to the development of Surrealistic artwork.

                    Carrington follows the path paved by Remedios Varo as one of the first women to 
                    contribute to the Surrealist movement, and also as one of the many surrealists working in Mexico. 
                    Having passed in 2011, Carrington was also one of the last living members of the 
                    surrealist movement. Her work and passion for surrealism was inspired by reading books 
                    and poetry on surrealism, including Herbert Read’s Surrealism.<br><br>
                    Along with producing her own art, Carrington also collaborated often with Max Ernst, 
                    with whom she also had a romantic relationship.

                    Inspired by artist Giorgio de Chirico and Paul Klee, Max Ernst is regarded as not 
                    only a surrealist artist, but also a founding member of the Dadaist movement. 
                    He is most famous for creating artistic techniques called frottage and grottage, both 
                    of which were rubbings made on objects or paintings. Ernst is also considered a major 
                    influence on the later Abstract Expressionism movement, which his son Jimmy was a part of.

                    highlight their shadows, angles, and grooves. The paintings combine artistic practice with 
                    mathematical puzzles, human bodies, and Shakespeare's romanticism.

                    Georges Papazoff or George Papazov (in Bulgarian: Жорж Папазов) was a Bulgarian painter 
                    and writer. He settled in France and was hailed as "one of the frontrunners of Surrealism". 
                    He was friends, among others, with Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee. 
                    Art historian Andrei Nakov rediscovered him and prepared a one-man exhibition at the 
                    Galerie de Seine in 1971, one year before his death. The monograph 
                    <i>Georges Papazoff: Franc-tireur du surréalisme</i> was published by Nakov in 1973 in Brussels. 
                    A contemporary art gallery in Bulgaria was named after Papazoff.

                    André Masson was a French artist known for his painting, sculpture, illustration, 
                    design, and writing. After studying in Brussels and Paris, he served in World War I, 
                    where he was severely wounded. In the 1920s, he became involved with the Surrealist movement, 
                    experimenting with automatic drawing and exploring themes of violence, metamorphosis, 
                    and eroticism. He lived in Spain in the mid-1930s, creating works inspired by bullfights 
                    and Spanish myths, before fleeing to the United States during World War II. After the war, 
                    Masson returned to France, where he focused on landscapes and abstract art, while also 
                    contributing to theater design and writing books, including <i>Mythologie d’André Masson</i>.

                    René Magritte was a Belgian Surrealist painter, best known for his thought-provoking 
                    and paradoxical imagery. Born in 1898, Magritte’s early experiences, including the 
                    death of his mother and the mystery surrounding it, influenced his work's themes of 
                    identity, reality, and illusion. His paintings often depicted ordinary objects in unusual 
                    contexts, challenging viewers' perceptions of reality, as seen in works like <i>The Son of Man</i> 
                    and <i>The Treachery of Images</i>. Magritte was inspired by philosophical ideas, particularly 
                    those of existentialism and the nature of perception, drawing on the works of thinkers 
                    like René Descartes and Immanuel Kant. Through his use of wit, wordplay, and visual puzzles, 
                    he aimed to provoke deeper questioning about the nature of truth and representation.

                    Eileen Agar was a British painter and photographer, known for her association with the 
                    Surrealist movement. Born in 1899 in Buenos Aires, she studied art in London and Paris, 
                    where she became influenced by the avant-garde and Surrealist circles. Her work often 
                    combined figurative elements with abstract forms, incorporating natural materials like 
                    shells and feathers to create textured, dreamlike compositions. Agar was inspired by the 
                    unconscious mind, the mystery of nature, and her travels, which led her to explore themes 
                    of transformation, fantasy, and the erotic. Throughout her career, she remained committed 
                    to experimentation, blending painting, collage, and photography to create a distinctive 
                    visual language that bridged Surrealism and modernism.
