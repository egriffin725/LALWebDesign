          <time>Andre Breton, 1925</time><br>
          Considered the founder of the Surealist art movement, Breton is most famous for publishing his <strong>"Manifeste du Surréalisme"</strong>, which outlined some of the principles of Surrealism and began to outline some examples of "automatic writing", which Breton used for many of his works. <br><br>
          “I believe in the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, if one may so speak.”
              <i>― André Breton, Manifestoes of Surrealism</i>

        <p><time>Joan Miro, 1925</time><br>
          Although not directly a part of the surrealist movement, Joan Miro's "automatic" paintings and interest in the "assassination of paintings" associated with Bourgeois art movements of the past, Miro's work is <em>heavily</em> influenced by Surrealism and Dadaism. Miro's work uses a variety of colors, animal symbols, and abstraction to break down the real world into the surrealist landscape. Similarly to some Dadaists, Miro was also influenced by music and other forms of artwork as inspirations to his visual creations.<br><br>
          “I try to apply colours like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.”<br>

        <p><time>Salvidor Dalí, 1930</time><br>
          In modern pop culture, Dalí's work is arguably some of the most recognizable surrealist art held in museums. His paintings distort reality by melting, twisting, and otherwise distorting already strange displays of objects. Many of his artworks investigate the subconscious mind through dreams. Similarly to many other artists in the surrealist movement, his artwork was also accompanied by writings that outlined his interest in the subconscious. Dalí was also famous for attempting to remain apolitical during the rise of Fascism in Spain, arguing that art could exist without supporting political initiatives.<br><br>
          Although he later parted ways with the Surrealist movement following disagreements on his political stance, Dalí's work continued to embody surrealist images and thinking until the end of his career.<br><br>
          "The only difference between me and the surrealists is that I am a surrealist"<br>

        <p><time>Remedios Varo, 1935</time><br>
          One of the earliest involved in the Surrealist movement, Remedios Varo broke barriers in the production of surrealist artwork that centered on women. Many of her artworks featured self-portraits and images documenting her travels and interactions with her peers. Varo was also one of the first Surrealists to work in North America, with most of her career occurring during her time living in Mexico. <br><br>
          Like other Surrealists, Varo’s work explored metaphysical and philosophical themes including scientific theories like Darwinism. While Andre Breton originally excluded women from the movement, Varo was also one of the first to be recognized by Breton to have contributed to the development of Surrealistic artwork. <br><br>
          “Everything that she did or undid, however disparate that looked to an observer with prejudices, was done for what should be done, that is, with courage and without fear of consequences.”<br>
          <i> - Remedios Varo</i><br><br>
          <i>While limited archival materials are available on Remedios Varos, you can see some of her work archived in the <a href="https://pmalibrary.libraryhost.com/repositories/3/archival_objects/133822">Philadelphia Museum of Art's Archives</a></i>

        <p><time>Leonora Carrington, 1940</time>Carrington follows the path paved by Remedios Varo as one of the first women to contribute to the Surrealist movement, and also as one of the many surrealists working in Mexico. Having passed in 2011, Carrington was also one of the last living members of the surrealist movement. Her work and passion for surrealism was inspired by reading books and poetry on surrealism, including Herbert Read’s <a href="https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=79131355&searchType=1&permalink=y"> Surrealism. </a><br><br>
        Along with producing her own art, Carrington also collaborated often with Max Ernst, with whom she also had a romantic relationship. <br><br>
        “You may not believe in magic but something very strange is happening at this very moment. Your head has dissolved into thin air and I can see the rhododendrons through your stomach. It's not that you are dead or anything dramatic like that, it is simply that you are fading away and I can't even remember your name.”<br>
        <i> ― Leonora Carrington, The Hearing Trumpet</i><br><br>

        <p><time>Max Ernst, 1945</time>Inspired by artist Giorgio de Chirico and Paul Klee, Max Ernst is regarded as not only a surrealist artist, but also a founding member of the Dadaist movement. He is most famous for creating artistic techniques called frottage and grottage, both of which were rubbings made on objects or paintings. Ernst is also considered a major influence on the later Abstract Expressionism movement, which his son Jimmy was a part of. <br><br>
          "Creativity is that marvelous capacity to grasp mutually distinct realities and draw a spark from their juxtaposition."<br>
          <i> - Max Ernst</i><br><br>
